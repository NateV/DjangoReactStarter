# Django-react starter app


This is a simple starter for a django app that serves a react frontend. 


## Set up

1. Install python environment with pipenv install
2. Install js pieces with npm install

## Develop

`pipenv shell` to activate the environment, and 

`python dev.py` to start the django server and an npm process to watch and build the files. 

## Deploy

TODO figure out how to deploy this nicely. In Docker? Heroku?
